I found a beautiful explanation about what property does the associativity capture.

> You can think of each element of a monoid as having two sides. The
> idea is that the left side and right side are independent things that
> don't interfere with each other. For example, adding some stuff at the
> beginning of a list, and adding some stuff at the end of a list, don't
> affect each other, and it doesn't matter which you do first.

> That's the idea that associativity captures.
