Recently I've been lucky to spend a few days in Belgium. I've come to Bruxelles,
spend two days to rush through Brugge and Gant and ended my journey with
a visit to René Magritte museum. I was quite impressed, partly because I have 
not seen much of Magritte before. This post is intended as a quick review of
my impressions and thoughts on Magritte style and his philosophy.


# First impressions
Magritte's style differs from his fellow surrealists such as Dali or Ernst. 
I've often got an impression that his approach is quite blunt, a bit like if he
threw objects into my face: 

* The depicted objects are big, relative to the canvas. It is strengthened by
the fact that the background is empty and not detailed.
* The palette has usually very few colors. Speaking of modern times, 
it is the same kind of restriction that exists in pixel art, and produces a
similar effect on me, that I rather like. 
* The colors used are rarely bright, which, in conjunction with the previous 
point, makes paintings look surreal, mystic and alien.
* The shadows and shapes are nicely detailed which makes for a highly contrast
image (although you won't see many sharp edges).

## The Riddler's choice 
Magritte's approach is also quite intellectual because he wants to mess with 
the viewers and make them think (and this is close to being his quote). Each 
pair of a picture and its name is a puzzle to solve. The reward is to comprehend
the message of a picture, which in turn can bring you some new understanding
about the real world. The name and the picture can be connected in a number of
ways, for example: 

* The name can be a hint to solve the riddle.

  Take "Explanation". It depicts two bottles, one of which looks
like half-bottle, half-carrot. As we see the image and its title, we come to 
an understanding of what an explanation is, its idea: the explanation is a 
process of changing our perception and/or understanding of concepts. This
changing is the transformation of an image of a bottle into an image of a
carrot.

* The name can be just something vaguely connected to what's on the painting.
For example, take the "Imp of the Perverse". The name should make you think
that something wrong is going on, make you uncomfortable, which should 
strengthen the feeling of wrongness coming from the piece of art itself.

In a sense, Magritte wants you to think critically, not make you trying to
connect distantly related terms. We can find a context to associate any pair
of words if we want to, though not all contexts are of importance to us.

* The name might hold an allusion to other works of art Magritte associated his 
painting with. For example, "The Man from the Sea" refers to the film of Marcel
L'Herbier, which tells a story of a lone sailor. More importantly, it resembles
the final scene of "Juve against Fantômas" where this villain in black prevails
by setting off an explosion with a pull of a lever.

# Objects, their images and words 
What's especially interesting about Magritte's philosophy is his reflections on
images, words and real world objects as well as the relations of the said three
worlds. He published his famous text "Words and images" in 1929 in
the journal _La révolution surréaliste_ as a result to his extensive
experimentation in the late 1920's.  It studies how words (e.g. poetry) and
paintings as the means of expressing ideas. Here is the text in French:

* _An object and its name are not inseparable. We can find a better name._ 
* _Some objects have no name_. Words are parts of languages, and there is no
a language which includes all notions from any other one. Take Dostoevsky's
"nadryv" or dozens of words for different states of snow in the local langauges
of northen tribes. 
* _A word can be used to refer you to itself._ This thought is illustrated by 
 a word "sky" inside a closed curve, depicting the said sky. As the label
 "sky" is placed directly on the image of sky, it refers to this exact instance 
 of "sky", which makes for a funny wordplay.
