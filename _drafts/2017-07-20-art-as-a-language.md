# What is information? 
Always a difference.


# How to encode and transfer information?

Active recreation of meaning by observing differences.
Relation to semiotics.
Almost always lossy.

# Why is art a language?

* Using contrasts to encode information.

## Context of interpretation

Why does an art object need a context
* Ambiguous and hence expressive.
* Members of a set of "sane interpretations" relate to each other creating food for thoughts


# Art and contrasts

Contrast as a unit of information.
