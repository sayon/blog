# What is information? 
Always a difference.


# How to encode and transfer information?

Active recreation of meaning by observing differences.
Relation to semiotics.
Almost always lossy.

# Why is art a language?

* Using contrasts to encode information.

## Context of interpretation

Why does an art object need a context
* Ambiguous and hence expressive.
* Members of a set of "sane interpretations" relate to each other creating food for thoughts


# Art and contrasts

Contrast as a unit of information.

## Estimated vs observed
patterns that we are used to vs  what we see/hear
 
### Music
* Gentle Giant -- 
* Frank Zappa --
* Pink Floyd -- Astronomy Domine

### Cinema
* Someone typical behaving in a non-typical way?
* Expecting genre cliche, but it is broken


### Paintings
* Someone typical behaving in a non-typical way
* Expecting real world objects, suprematism

## Different pace

### Music

* Polyrhythms
* Small chunks in different rhythms 
* Bach Fugues, subject in different tempos


### Cinema
* Slow motion
* 

### Paintings 


### Dance



## Very similar emphasises differences

### Music
Stravinsky, instruments with different sound colors
Van Der Graaf Generator: Hammil and sax
clavinet and guitar?

### Cinema
Legion arc


### Paintings

Hello Ron, and sorry for a possible disturbance. 

I am just a stranger who has seen one of your answers on Quora and realised that you are probably the right person to ask a question about art. This question bugs me for quite a long time already.

My vision of art is primarly as of a highly ambiguous language that encodes information using all sorts of contrasts available (a contrast meaning any difference). A person decodes the meanings by making observations and taking a cumulative context into account (one's own cultural background, artist's personality, historical events, dominating philosophical concepts of the era -- whatever). Correct me if I am wrong, but judging from your answers I imply that we have more or less of a common ground here.

The contrasts  of different art forms are usually of different nature and can not be directly reproduced in other art forms. Cinema or music can work with time, paintings not so much. 

Now what I would be willing to investigate are the types of contrasts common between all types of arts. For example, I think that at least the following types of contrasts are common between different types of art:

1. Polyrythms.  When there are several characteristics that change with different speed or frequency.

2. What one expects vs what one sees. It might be something that seems exotic by comparing it with 'canons', or breaking a pattern that one learns through preceding observation. 

3. Placing something very similar together emphasises differences. 

Now I do not expect myself being the first curious art observer in the world who tried to abstract and systematize contrasts in some kind of a meta-system, but my attempts at finding some existing research have failed so far. I probably do not know the right keywords, not being educated enough in this area. If what I said rings a bell for you, would you be so kind to point me in the right direction? Thank you.
