The first version of this blog was based on WordPress, then I switched to markdown and Jekyll.
Finally, because the Jekyll themes turned to be unstable as the necessary gems
were updated, I have decided to switch to =org-mode=, which I was already using daily.
I have to thank [[https://github.com/superbobry][Sergey Lebedev]] and [[https://grall.name][Herv√© Grall]] for influencing this decision.

The current version of this blog is generated by Emacs using =org-publish= [ [[https://github.com/sayon/blog][sources]] ].
