* Hello
My name is Igor Zhirkov, you may encounter me in Nantes, Warsaw, or St.Petersburg.

Keywords: PhD student, Computer Science, programmer, musician, writer.

I am interested in maths, programming, programming languages, automated theorem proving, and system design.
I have written a [[http://amazon.com/Low-Level-Programming-Assembly-Execution-Architecture/dp/1484224027][book]] about low-level programming for my students; this is a slightly outdated version of the class I was teaching in  
ITMO university in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Currently I am pursuing my PhD on verified C refactorings.

As for music, I am an amateur pianist.
My preferences are baroque and late-romantic music, progressive rock, jazz fusion, and various types of electronic music. 

Feel free to drop me a line by [[mailto:igorjirkov@gmail.com][mail]] or in [[https://t.me/igorjirkov][telegram]].
English, french, german and russian are accepted.

This blog is named after my friend Mr. Duck. He is a snobbish, intellectual, and slightly misanthropic.

I am migrating this site from jekyll to org-mode because of stability reasons. Not all posts are yet moved.
