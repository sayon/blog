* Hello

Igor Zhirkov, mostly Warsaw or Nantes, between who I was and who I'm becoming.

I live by the code: to be and not to seem.

I am interested in philosophy, maths, programming, programming languages theory,
and system design. I approach everything through language, engineering and systems.

I have written a [[http://amazon.com/Low-Level-Programming-Assembly-Execution-Architecture/dp/1484224027][book]] about low-level programming for my students; this is a
slightly outdated version of the class I was teaching in ITMO university in St.
Petersburg, Russia. I've spent around 14 years teaching; I don't do it anymore,
but you can still check my online course on C hosted on [[https://stepik.org/course/73618][Stepik]] (in Russian).

I am an amateur pianist. My preferences are baroque and late-romantic music,
progressive rock, jazz fusion, and various types of electronic music. These days
Bach is my favorite form of meditation -- we all could use some of his mental
health.

I exist best underwater, for now I am certified as AOWD but I am interesting in going further.

Feel free to drop me a line by [[mailto:igorjirkov@gmail.com][mail]] or in [[https://t.me/igorjirkov][telegram]].
I speak English, French, German, Russian, and basic Polish.

This blog is named after my friend Mr. Duck. He is a snobbish, intellectual, and slightly misanthropic gentleman.
