I found a beautiful explanation about what essential property does the associativity
capture: You can think of each element of a monoid as having two sides. The idea
is that the /left side and right side are independent things that don't interfere
with each other/.

For example, adding an element at the beginning of a list is independent from 
adding something at the end of a list. These actions do not affect each other, and it doesn't
matter which you do first. That's the idea that associativity captures.
