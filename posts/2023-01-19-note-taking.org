  #+excerpt: A workflow of reading, annotating, and note-keeping.
  #+filetags: :education:self-improvement:reading:


  There is a (toxic) productivity hype on YouTube.
  Everyone is making a video about it, explaining, how to achieve all great things in 24 hours.
  Apparently, it is mandatory to use Obsidian or Notion, waking up at 4AM, thanking every object in the room, going for a
  jog and only then starting your work day.
  I do not think that I am particularly productive, but I am certainly more
  productive then /some/, so for them and for the curious I am writing this post.

* Structure
I have spent several years in trying to perfect a system that could work for me.
While it is not ideal and does not work as good as I want, it /actually works for
months now/, which is a great progress for me.
It has also brought more order into my life, eliminated friction and helped systematize
all my intellectual activities.

The main components of my system are:

1) Zettelkasten, stored in a git repository and organized in Emacs with =org-mode= and =org-roam=.
2) Book storage: cloud storage with digital articles and books, and a bookshelf
   with physical books.
3) Galaxy Tab7 FE, an Android tablet with a stylus to keep a working set of
   documents and annotate them.
4) An e-ink reader, which mirrors a part of my collection of books.

The main stages of my workflow are:

- Reading/watching and making notes as I go.
- Revising, copying notes to my long-term note storage.

Now, to the details.

* Data flow

Most of the time, I study by reading books, articles, and blog posts.
Watching videos is less convenient, but sometimes I have no choice.
I will illustrate the workflow on an example of a physical book.

** Introduction to the source

First, I need to get a general idea of what is happening in the book.
Linear reading is inconvenient for the task, so we need to approach the text structurally.

To begin, I am looking at the table of contents, skimming through pages, reading
the section headers, sometimes section introductions.
It is enjoyable doing this with a physical book!

Often, the book is either not entirely new for me, or only some chapters are
useful ---  it is necessary to identify them before you actually read the book.
This stage is even more important if the book is not an easy reading: sometimes,
getting through every single page may require an extensive research and exhausting
thinking.

My goals at this stage are:

1. Familiarize myself with the book structure.
2. Ask Google/ChatGPT about the meaning of unknown technical terms.
3. Identify my goals in reading this specific book.
4. Think for a moment about the questions that appear in my head after skimming
   through the book.

Some books are going an extra mile to guide the reader, for example,
[[https://thenetworkstate.com/]["The Network State"]]  starts with sections "The book in one sentence", "The book
in one image", "The book in one thousand words", and "The book in one essay".
This is a didactic approach that I am also using with my students: guide to
ideas through a series of increasingly detailed approximations.

** Annotating the source

Once I have a general idea of what to expect from the book, I start reading and
annotating it.
As a kid, I was reading really fast and with extremely poor retention, so now if I am
serious about working through the text, I am annotating it.
I use a set of four pencils: violet, blue, red, and green, and four highlighters of the same colors.
When something picks my interest, I highlight a fragment of text with one of
these colors and write text on margins in the same color. This way a commentary
is matched to a fragment.

There is a logic to color coding:

+ *Violet* is for summarizing. It is well visible on paper and also
  distinguishable from black, so it does not fuse with the text.

  It is *not useful* to highlight without commenting. For me, writing summary is
  a useful part, and highlighting is optional [fn:1].

+ *Blue* is for connections. It reminds me of hyperlinks on Web pages.
  With blue I mark reasonable connections to other topics, writers, or books.
  Connections greatly enhance retention.

+ *Red* is for questions and critique. It attracts the most attention and is
  associated with danger. I use it if I do not agree with something written, or
  if I do not understand it.

+ *Green* is for everything else. It is a safe, a bit disconnected color. If my
  curiosity suggests me a possible connection to my previous readings, if I get
  an idea on how to solve some problem, an analogy, a metaphor, then it is worth
  noting it. Basically, this is the color for everything else.

I am never waiting to finish one book before starting another, so my working set
of sources is usually large.
It helps establishing more connections; sometimes, it also enhances
understanding, since I am exposed to several explanations of the same concepts,
often from different points of view.

Every now and then I revise the notes to add information to my permanent note storage.

** Storing notes

The core of my system is Zettelkasten.
In short, it is a personal Wiki with small subjective articles
and annotated subjective connections between them.
Each "wiki article" is a note on something: a concept, an idea, a book, an article
etc.
After some reading, it is time to revise my notes, skimming through
the book again, and put bits of notes to the appropriate articles.

For me, there are advantages of taking notes in two stages:

- It forces me to come back to notes in a systemic way; I quickly re-read,
  discover things that I miss and memorize information again.
- It combines the advantages of hand-writing (good for retention, sheets are more "personal", stimulates thinking) and digital note-taking
  (speed, ease of searching, version control, digital illustrations, etc).

Subjectively, I have noticed that I remember more since I have started doing two
stages, as opposed to just writing digital textual notes right away.


I use =emacs= with =org-roam= to keep my Zettelkasten organized, easily search through them and
explore them with =org-roam-ui=.


Here is an example of a note:

... and its source code:

The note contains:

1) An identifier for =org-roam= (generated automatically)
   #+begin_src
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       22AF419C-C79F-42A6-B7E9-CF7A27DAD5E0
:END:
   #+end_src
2) Title
3) Tags (we can then search by them)
4) Sections with content. Text supports markup: underline/bold/italic,
   monospace, strike-through and alike; it may contain pictures (there is a
   convenient way of including shot of a part of the screen through
   =org-download-screenshot=).
5) A special section for connections to other notes
   Personally, I am also putting links to other notes directly into the body of
   the note. The special section is precious to provide subjective annotations for
   the links: why do I think there is a connection between this note and another
   one.

I used to have two sections: for links to the sources, and for related notes, but now I tend
to just merge both into "Related".

I keep most metadata out of the way by putting it in the end of the note.

* What about digital sources?

I am doing a lot of reading on my tablet as well, because I have most books and
articles only in digital format.
For that, I have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab7 Fan Edition this summer, and it is
just really good for me:

- The screen is big (and I never felt like I have enough screen space for
  comfortable handwriting before)
- Samsung S-Pen feels good to me, better than Apple pencil. The feel is a bit
  closer to the fountain pen, which is my writing tool of preference on paper.
- The performance is adequate for everything I need.

As for software, I found that Flexcil works best for me.
It does not choke when I am keeping 40 tabs with documents open, is responsive
and easily handles even huge books like
[[http://www.topology.org/tex/conc/dg.html][Differential geometry reconstructed]], which has around 2500 pages as of today.

The editing capabilities are not great, e.g. you can not rotate your handwritten
text, and the Android version lacks a good synchronization mechanism -- you
basically have to do backups and restore them.
The backup process is fast, so I am doing it most of the days.
Once these things get fixed, it will become an ideal tool for me.

For the pleasure reading, when I am not annotating, I prefer using my
old e-ink reader PocketBook 902, which has a reasonably big screen.
It has now turned 12 years old, and still works like a charm.

I was considering buying an e-ink tablet for annotating, but I find that having
color on annotation is too great. The current color e-ink tablets were not
convincing to me for various reasons.


* Pitfalls

- Do not try to create a hierarchy (taxonomy) for your notes. It is not
  scalable and only works for narrow domain. Prefer tags.

- I did not perceive this system as too complicated, until I have written this
  post. Start small, build a habit, grow as you see fit.

- Without habit, Zettelkasten will stay empty. You may need to force yourself to
  stop reading at some point, revise your notes and put them to the permanent
  database.
  Do not delay until you forget the source and recalling the information will be
  difficult.

- Redundancy is good. You will naturally put the same information in many notes,
  and *it is all right*.

- Drawing is great. Emacs and org notes support =.svg= files, but you can also include
  photos or screenshots of your hand-drawn diagrams, why not.
- Think carefully which software you will be using (if any).
  It is great to have
  the second brain for life.
  My first digital notes were in some note-taking app for Symbian
  OS, then in Evernote.
  These programs are proprietary and do not always have an easy way for you to migrate your notes somewhere else.
  Emacs (and text files) is clearly not everyone's darling, but it has been around for more, than
  I am alive, so I am quite certain that:
  - either I will be able to keep my notes there for life,
  - or I will be able to migrate them somewhere should such need arise.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Most texts are not too dense and include a fair percentage of redundancy,
so you can summarize them in a useful way. There are, of course, exceptions, for
example, /Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus/ of Ludwig Wittgenstein, where the book
is a structured tree of key points of his word view from that time. In this case
I had to keep the annotations separated from the book.
