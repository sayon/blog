Can we put a sphere with a bigger radius inside of a smaller one so that it
would be fully contained? The answer is yes, but we have to select the space we
are working in carefully. I am going to provide two examples here:

* First example: metric space

Suppose we are in a metric space with Euclidean metric. The space is a sphere itself, with radius $r$. Let us denote a closed sphere of radius $r$ with center at 0 as $D_r(0)$. This sphere is a subset of $R^n$.

What is a sphere? By definition it is a point of a space and a set of such points that are no further than the sphere's radius.
What if we try to define a sphere of radius $R > r$ inside the space we are working in?

Why does this sphere look as an intersection of two? We are, by definition, effectively selecting a **subset** of points of space $D_r(0)$ whose distance to $B$ is less or equal to $r$. Any point of $R^n$ lying outside of $D_r(0)$ is out of reach.

As long as $R < 2r$, we can fit a bigger sphere inside of a smaller one. Once we cross the $2r$ border, even if we pick a center $B$ on the border of the $D_r(0)$, the longest distance between two points inside of $D_r(0)$ can not surpass $2r$. Thus, all points will be contained inside of $D_R(B)$.


* Second example

We can also pick up a less traditional kind of space, for example, a graph. Let us label its edges with numbers and take the shortest path as a metric.

It is easy to see that $D_{1.5}(D) \subset D_{1}(C)$, for:


$$D_{1.5}(D) = \{ D, A, C\}$$

$$D_{1}(C) = \{C, D, A, E\}$$
