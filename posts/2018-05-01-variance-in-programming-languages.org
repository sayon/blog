#+excerpt: Concepts of variance and contravariance in type systems of programming languages.
#+filetags: :education:

/Covariance/, /invariance/, and /contravariance/ are concepts many students have difficulties to grasp. However, the idea behind them is pretty simple. This post will attempt to illustrate that in a shortest and simplest way possible.

Take an imaginary object-oriented language with generic types. Java or C# will do. We are going to draw diagrams, where rectangles represent types and arrows represent a relation "is parent of".

=A= $\rightarrow$ =B= means "=A= is a parent of =B=", or, in other words, "=A=
is a supertype of =B=".

Let's create two hierarchies: 
- one consists of three classes, each with a type parameter: =A=, =B= and =C= ;
- the other contains no parameterized types: =x=, =y=, =z=.

Now we will draw a 3x3 matrix with all possible substitutions of =x=, =y= and =z= as type parameters of =A<T>=, =B<T>= and =C<T>=, like this:

[[../img/two-hierarchies.png]]

You already see the arrows like =A<x>= $\rightarrow$ =B<x>=; these are not
going anywhere, they are valid for any value of type argument.


What is of interest to us is: for a parameterized type such as =A=, how will
=A<x>= and =A<y>= be related? 

There can be three cases:

- Invariance :: whatever relation exists between =x= and =y=, =A<x>= and =A<y>= have no relation whatsoever. 
- Covariance :: if =x= $\rightarrow$ =y=, then =A<x>= $\rightarrow$ =A<y>=.
- Contravariance :: if =x= $\leftarrow$ =y=, then =A<x>= $\rightarrow$ =A<y>=.

It's all on the picture: for invariance, =A<x>= and =A<y>= are not connected for
=x= $\neq$ =y=; for covariance, we draw more arrows according to the hierarchy
of type arguments themselves; for contravariance, we invert these arrows.


* Language prerequisites

In order for variance to even exist we need the language to have the following
features:

- It has to be typed
- It should sometimes allow an entity of type _A_ to be implicitly interpreted
  as an entity of type _B_.

  The most common cases are:
    * /Subtyping/ in class hierarchies. 
    
       Basically, everything that has an "Object Oriented Programming" label on
       it: C++, C#, Java etc.
    * Implicit type conversions (/coercions/).
      
       For example, in C/C++/Java, there are implicit conversions from numeric
       types into their wider versions, like =short= to =long=, or =float= to
       =double=.
   
- We also need parameterized types. 
    
  It does not mean a presence of generics though, as functions alone are enough
  to introduce covariance and contravariance.
   
In other words, we need to be able to represent types as an oriented graph.

* Common facts

Here I want to mention a couple of facts it is useful to be aware of.

** Function variance

Functions are contravariant on arguments and covariant on return type. Why so?

- A function that returns a =Cat= can be used to fill a variable of type
  =Animal=. Hence we got the "natural" way: =Animal= is more generic than =Cat=,
  function returning =Animal= is more generic than function returning =Cat=.
- If you need a function that can work on =Cat= (its argument), it is safe to
  use a function that can work on =Animal= instead, or any supertype of =Cat=.
  Hence, the function with a more generic argument type is of a _more specific_ type itself.

** Variance and mutability

As a rule of thumb, _immutable collections can be covariant, mutable collections should be invariant_.

Imagine, that a mutable =List= is covariant. Then take a =List<String>=. You can
reinterpret it as a =List<Object>=, because =Object= $\rightarrow$ =String=.
That list can store anything, so it is a valid operation to add an integer to
it. From the type perspective, its method =set (int idx, T value)= will become 
=set(int idx, Object value)=, so it is valid to give it an integer as a value.
If we do it, we are screwed because we just have added an integer to a list
that assumes it is holding strings, the objects of an incompatible type,
effectively hacking the type system.

The next time when we try to use some function like =printString= on all
elements of the said list, we are up for some surprises, ranging (depending on
the language semantics) from runtime errors, to undefined behavior.

In Scala, if you try to define a covariant List, you will get warned on the
definition of its =set= method, that accepts an argument of type =T=
(corresponding to the list contents). As an argument of =set=, =T= should be
contravariant (as in any function), but as a type parameter of =List=, it will
be marked as covariant (because we made it so in =List= definition). Hence the
warning: "Covariant argument in contravariant position".

Immutable collections do not have such problem. If we try to replicate that
example, we will just get a new =List= of objects, for which it is perfectly
fine to store everything you might want it to.
