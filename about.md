### Igor Zhirkov

PhD student in Computer Science, musician, now writer.

Deeply interested in logic, type theories, automated theorem proving and low-level programming. I have written a [book](http://amazon.com/Low-Level-Programming-Assembly-Execution-Architecture/dp/1484224027) about low-level programming to present my course that I was teaching for almost 6 years in ITMO university in St. Petersburg, Russia.  

Currently I am pursuing my PhD thesis on verified C refactorings at IMT Atlantique, Nantes.


Being an amateur pianist, I also learn bass guitar. My preferences are baroque and late-romantic music as well as progressive rock and jazz fusion; I am also very fond of various types of electronic music.  

Feel free to drop me a line by mail. English, french, german and russian are accepted.

This blog is named after my friend Mr. Duck. He is a snobbish, intellectual, and misanthropic gentleman.
